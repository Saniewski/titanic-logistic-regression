# Titanic Logistic Regression

A logistic regression model predicting the survival of the Titanic passengers.

Data comes from [Kaggle Titanic Competition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

Notebooks feature a comparison of three models trained on differently imputed data (non-imputed, median imputed, and an imputation based on another, correlated feature).
